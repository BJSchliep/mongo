# mongo# Overview

This software was my beginner attempt in learning Mongodb. This program has a menu option that includes insert a new name, to delete a user, modify their age, find people who fit a certain query, and the option to leave. 

I wanted to make this program to learn Mongodb and PyMongo. With Python being my strongest language I wanted to build on that skill.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I would use Tinker to be able to make a pop-up window that would improve the UI for users.
- I would find more abilities of Mongodb to inscrease my skills
